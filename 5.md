Inside the for loop, complete the following:
If the price of the app is 0.0, then label the app as "free" by appending the string 'free' to the current iteration variable.
Else, label the app "not free" by appending the string 'not free' to the current iteration variable. Don't write 'not_free' for 'not free'.
By adding labels to the end of each row, we basically created a new column. Name this column "free_or_not" by appending the string 'free_or_not' to the first row of the apps_data data set. Do this outside the for loop.
Print the header row and the first five rows to see some of the changes we made.

```python

opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)

for app in apps_data[1:]:
    price = float(app[4])
    # Complete code from here
    if price==0.0:
        app.append("free")
    else:
        app.append("not free")
apps_data[0].append("free_or_not")
print(apps_data[0:5])
