"Social Networking" or "Games."
Assign the result to a variable named avg_not_free.
Try to complete this exercise without any additional guidance. You may feel a bit confused at first, but we've practiced the steps you need to solve this kind of problem several times. Essentially, the code is almost identical to what we used to extract the ratings for free gaming or social networking apps.

```python
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)

free_games_social_ratings = []
not_free_games_social_ratings=[]
for row in apps_data[1:]:
    rating = float(row[7])
    genre = row[11]
    price = float(row[4])
    
    if (genre == 'Social Networking' or genre == 'Games') and price == 0:
        free_games_social_ratings.append(rating)
     
    elif (genre == 'Social Networking' or genre == 'Games') and price != 0:
        not_free_games_social_ratings.append(rating)
        
        
avg_free = sum(free_games_social_ratings) / len(free_games_social_ratings)

# Not-free apps (average)
avg_not_free=sum(not_free_games_social_ratings)/len(not_free_games_social_ratings)
