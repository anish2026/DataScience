Compute the average rating of the apps that have a price greater than $9.


Using a for loop, isolate the ratings of all the apps that have a price greater than $9. When you iterate over apps_data, don't include the header row.

Find the average value of these ratings and assign the result to a variable named avg_rating.

Determine how many apps have a price greater than $9 and assign the result to a variable named n_apps_more_9. You can use the list of ratings from the previous question to find the answer.

Determine how many apps have a price less than or equal to $9 and assign the result to a variable named n_apps_less_9. The list of ratings from the first question can help you find a quick answer.

```python
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)

rating_price_9=[]
apps_more_9=[]
apps_less_9=[]
for row in apps_data[1:]:
    price=float(row[4])
    rating=float(row[7])
    if price > 9:
        rating_price_9.append(rating)
        apps_more_9.append(price)
    else:
        apps_less_9.append(price)
        
avg_rating=sum(rating_price_9)/len(rating_price_9)
n_apps_more_9=len(apps_more_9)
n_apps_less_9=len(apps_less_9)
