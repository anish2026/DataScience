Complete the code in the editor to label each app as "below average", "roughly average", or "better than average" depending on its rating.

Inside the for loop, complete the following:
If the app rating is less than 3.0, then label the app as "below average" by appending the string 'below average' to the current iteration variable.
Else if the app rating is greater than or equal to 3.0 and below 4.0, then label the app as "roughly average" by appending the string 'roughly average' to the current iteration variable.
Else if the app rating is greater than or equal to 4.0 label the app "better than average" by appending the string 'better than average' to the current iteration variable.
Print app_ratings to see the results.


```python

app_ratings = [['Facebook', 3.5], ['Notion', 4.0], ['Astropad Standard', 4.5], ['NAVIGON Europe', 3.5]]

for app in app_ratings[0:]:
    if app[1] < 3.0:
        app.append("below average")
    elif app[1] >= 3.0 and app[1] < 4.0:
        app.append("roughly average")
    else:
        app.append("better than average")
print(app_ratings)
