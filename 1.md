Inside the for loop, append the rating to the free_games_ratings list if the price equals 0.0 and the genre equals 'Games'.
Outside the for loop, compute the average rating of free gaming apps. Assign the result to a variable named avg_rating_free_games.

```python 
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)

free_games_ratings = []
for row in apps_data[1:]:
    rating = float(row[7])
    price = float(row[4])
    genre = row[11]
    if price==0.0 and genre=="Games":
        free_games_ratings.append(rating)
        
    # Complete code from here
avg_rating_free_games=sum(free_games_ratings)/len(free_games_ratings)
